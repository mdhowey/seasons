# Seasons (React Practice)

## Description

- This was built while going through the Udemy course called *Modern React with Redux* by Stephen Grider
- Using geolocation, Seasons identifies whether the user is in the northern or southern hemisphere
- Based on the user's location, that app displays a generic summer or winter background and message 

## What I Learned
- How to compartmentalize functionality 
- How to use geolocation and get it to return latitude
- Gained more understanding of React basics (i.e.- using state and props)
- Created a renderContent() function that broke up the conditional rendering within the index.js render() method

### Again, this is not my personal work! I followed along with the above course to create this application.
